If a variable X is a numerically valued function whose domain is the sample space of probability experiment with a finite or countably finite number of outcomes, then we can say that X is a discrete random variable. A table which indicate the value of $Pr(X=x)$ is called the probability distribution. This table gives a concrete view of how the probability is distributed. Of course, each probability in the distribution should be larger than 0 and less of equal to 1 and the sum of all probabilities should be 1.

As for a cumulative distribution function, it follows $Pr(X=x_i)= F(x_i)-F(x_{i-1})$ and $F(\infty)=1$. The CDF function can be represented by ogive graph and CDF graph.
